        <h2>StateFarm Announcement Board</h2>
        <p><strong>05/22/2025</strong> - Takedown Announcement</p>
        <p>Due to wrongful DMCA takedown requests by Blue Wizard Digital Inc., StateFarm Client is currently unavailable on GitHub, GreasyFork, and for download on Discord. They have threatened GreasyFork's owner with false hosting takedown requests in order to pressure him into removing our projects from the platform. Our development team will not tolerate this unjust and targeted legal oppression of our project. Thank you all for continued support. We hope to have this resolved soon. For now, the script is downloadable via this website only.</p>
